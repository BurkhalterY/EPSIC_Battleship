# EPSIC Battleship ðŸš¢

A fully functional battleship game with numerous additional features like "sonars" and "nuclear bombs".

This game was created for one of my IT courses at EPSIC in 2019.

This project has two repos:
- https://github.com/BurkhalterY/EPSIC_Battleship
- https://github.com/Yannis-edu/EPSIC_Bataille_Navale

This one is in both English and French and is the most up-to-date.

While the one from Yannis-edu is the version I handed for my EPSIC course. It's almost all in French and it will not be updated anymore. The organisation Yannis-edu is all dedicated to my school projects.

This repo (BurkhalterY) is a fork of the Yannis-edu's one.

## Getting Started

You can download a build from the [Release page](https://github.com/Yannis-edu/EPSIC_Bataille_Navale/releases) of the original project (Yannis-edu).

If you want to build the project by yourself, you'll need Visual Studio (because Microsoft). There is no special procedure.

## Built With

- C# and .NET Framework 4.7.2
- WPF (GUI)

## Contributing

This project is not actively maintained, but feel free to contribute. I'll read all issues and PR.
